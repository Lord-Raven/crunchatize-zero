Need those dice? Need 'em now? Stats just getting in the way?! Crunchatize Zero is an adrenaline shot of chance straight into your gamer veins!!<br>
<br>
**What's it do?**<br>
Add this stage from Chat Settings to turn most inputs into a generic skill check that determines your degree of success.
Dice will be rolled and a modifier added to determine whether you succeed or fail.
<br><br>
Unlike most chats, where you don't want the bot to speak or act for your character, 
this stage asks you to forfeit some agency over the details of your actions; 
the bot will be specifically instructed to take your skill check result and paraphrase your choices as it narrates, rather than accept your input as canon. 
As a result, you may find that you are better off simply describing the nature of your words or actions and allow the bot to fill in the details.
<br><br>
The stage is vaguely inspired by \"Powered by the Apocalypse\" rules, where 2d6 are rolled and modifiers added or subtracted to arrive at 
one of four degrees of success: failure, mixed success, straight success, and critical success. 
This result informs the LLM how the narrative should unfold.
